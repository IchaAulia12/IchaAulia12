@markys99,"Oh my god, their voices fit together so well. We can see from Red Lights that Bangchan and Hyunjin together have such a unique style of music that they could easily release an album in that vibe that we would love. The story of this MV is so beautiful, the tense parts, the handcuffs, the holding hands, all the acting and the hug, everything was so well written and constructed that I&#39;m still shocked.

But behind that smile, there was a hidden sadness and loneliness that no one knew about.<br><br>One day, after finishing a concert, Bang Chan returned to the dorm feeling tired and empty. It felt like he had lost something very important to him.<br><br>He remembered his time in Australia, when he was just a student and dreamed of becoming a singer. He thought about how he had to struggle alone without support from his family or friends.<br><br>As he thought about how he had lost contact with his family for so many years, tears began to fall from his eyes. He felt like he had lost himself.<br><br>Bang Chan lay down on his bed, feeling weak and drained. He couldn&#39;t hold back his tears anymore and began to cry loudly.<br><br>Suddenly, the door to his room opened, and Han, one of the members of Stray Kids, came in. Han saw Bang Chan crying and immediately walked over to him.<br><br>&quot;Chan-hyung, what&#39;s wrong?&quot; Han asked, looking worried.<br><br>Bang Chan couldn’t speak, as his tears kept flowing. Han quickly hugged him and let him cry.<br><br>“We’re here for you, Chan-hyung,” Han said. “We’ll always support you, no matter what.”<br>Hearing Han&#39;s words made Bang Chan feel a little better. He realized that he wasn’t alone, and that he had friends who would always be there for him.<br><br>With tears still in his eyes, Bang Chan smiled faintly. He knew that, with friends like Han by his side, he could get through anything.",2,2025-03-29T09:10:38Z,0

@Ruba327,"This is my personal interpretation of Escape—a story that reached deep into my heart and stayed there. Thank you, Chan and Hyunjin, for creating something so raw, powerful, and true.<br>After watching Escape multiple times and reflecting deeply—while also listening to others’ takes—I felt compelled to share what I saw and felt in my heart.<br><br>Escape is a profound visual metaphor for breaking free from societal expectations, internal pain, and the pressure to conform. The opening—Chan and Hyunjin butting heads like wild animals—quickly shifts to both being chained. Yet each breaks free, returning to their truest selves: Chan moving like a wolf, and Hyunjin swift and stealthy, like a ferret.<br><br>They meet again and fight—at first seriously, then playfully, as the fight transforms into companionship. This brings them closer to their true selves, symbolized by paw prints in the sand instead of footprints. During Chan’s high-pitched vocal moment, they stare into a fish tank—symbolic of beauty trapped, observed, and contained, just like themselves. Chan breaks the glass and hands Hyunjin a dagger-like shard. It’s not a weapon—it’s a symbol of trust and survival. Chan rests his head on Hyunjin in protective love, while Hyunjin looks unhinged—care and chaos in stark contrast.<br><br>Chan watches over Hyunjin as the latter unleashes his pent-up emotions. At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvCmsOWPwKA&amp;t=103"">1:43</a> (possibly referencing “CASE 143”), Chan sees black, inky shadow-hands pressed against a window—souls trapped, begging for freedom. Sensing danger, he grabs Hyunjin and runs. They hide, but Hyunjin breaks down and runs off, dagger in hand.<br><br>Chan panics. Hyunjin is shown imprisoned again—crouched, terrified, desperate, and alone. Chan, separately, is bound not by chains, but by grief and guilt. When he howls at the moon, both their chains break—it’s a spiritual rescue.<br><br>They run toward each other—Hyunjin desperate, Chan smiling. A flash of a white ferret and black wolf confirms they are truly themselves. They embrace, and then we see them in fur coats that match their animals.<br><br>Then they face the eerie truck—its blinding lights symbolizing surveillance, fame, and oppression. Chan looks afraid—for Hyunjin. But Hyunjin’s defiance gives him strength. They clasp hands, charge forward—glass shatters. Liberation.<br><br>A masterpiece of authenticity, protection, and shared freedom. The story of Stray Kids—and of everyone seeking their voice in this world.",1,2025-03-29T05:24:36Z,0

@faramoan77,"My favorite is the personal infusion of Hyunchan in the storyline...Chan taking care of Hyunjin, sharing food, giving him a weapon, grabbing him to run...and Hyunjin ready to fight, defend and protect Chan at any moment, including the last.. And it seems reflective of their actual bond.<br>Of course we&#39;ve seen Chan take care of people he loves, like Jinnie but there are so many times where Hyunjin has been guard for Chan, even with Chan himself - making sure he eats well, reassuring/defending him when fans criticize his &quot;cuteness&quot; recently, diffusing situations when he sees Chan is uncomfortable. They definitely have chemistry but I think their connection is notable",113,2025-03-28T15:28:37Z,3

@lunarphasegaming,"1 to see the ferret and wolf in the smoke was really something unique, and for those who don&#39;t really know, Ferrets are fearless critters, just as wolves. While wolves can be more cautious, ferrets give it their all every time. They don&#39;t care the size, speed or shape... Hyunjin has evolved so much and embodies that to a tee I&#39;m so happy to see this representation of not just him but a fearless and chaotic ferret in this video...",10,2025-03-28T07:00:38Z,0

@Hart-Strings,"A lot of amazing observations have been made, but I haven’t seen this one mentioned yet. The guys are in regular jackets, then they run at each other, colliding. When the dust clears and they’re still holding on to each other, the coats change. They become furs the color of their animals. <br>Are they fully embracing their inner beasts?<br><br>I’ve also found the fish tank to be great imagery. Following the expression, living in a fish bowl, with all you do exposed for anyone to see. And they not only seemed to break it (Escaping, but at a cost (especially to the fish)), but turned the thing confining them into weapons for their freedom. <br><br>I think I could write an essay over all the rich content of the lyrics and M/V.

Escape has such a POWERFUL beat. 🔥 The lyrics are INSANELY AWESOME. 🙌 Hyunjin’s singing voice is MAGICAL, I swear it has such a SOOTHING effect on my soul. 😊 Bang Chan’s vocals are on ANOTHER LEVEL! His voice at the beginning of second verse is just WOW, like whaaaaaat?! 🤩 The entire song is incredibly AMAZING. The MV is so COOL, truly a mini movie. 🍿 Love the apocalyptic setting, the concept of being captured/held back, and escaping/facing whatever comes together. The spirit animals running toward each other, when they are running to hug each other, is such a GENIUS idea. Loved it! Love the hug. 🤗 Anyway, so much to say - I looooove this song.

@EleesTink,"As for Idol groups, SKZ have shattered the mundane mold. Their style and choreography are both impressive and fierce. Their incredible music spans different genres—some songs are pop-rock, others rap and some retain the usual pop sound. These boys are talented, charming, and good-looking. Their stage presence is commanding, unique, provocative, and undeniably attractive. SKZ have given new life to K-pop and paved the way for originality. They are different; they stand out and are beautiful, and everyone has fallen in love with them.<br><br>SKZ, always and forever!🧍🏻‍♀🏆🧍🏻‍♂🎶🧍🏻📀🎵🧍🏻🎤🧑🏼‍🤝‍🧑🏻👑 👫🏻💫❤",18,2025-03-27T06:06:52Z,0

@tgfvfrd34tfrey,"The Courier Mail: Survivor Exposes the New Details about the Forced Organ Harvesting<br>The Courier Mail carried a report on August 14 titled, “China’s barbaric practice of live organ harvesting exposed by survivor.” It reads that new details about the horrifying practice of forcibly removing the internal organs of live political prisoners has been exposed by a survivor.<br><br>The report reads, “A man who managed to survive China’s barbaric practice of forcibly harvesting the organs of political prisoners, mostly while they are still alive, has broken his silence at an explosive press conference.”<br><br>Mr. Cheng was detained for practicing Falun Gong in 1999. After being held for three years, he was sentenced to eight years in prison, where he suffered tortures routinely.<br><br>“Among the acts he was subjected to was an interrogation tactic known as ‘the big stretch,’ where his arms and legs were painfully extended by ropes to the point of his skin almost tearing.”<br><br>“In late 2004, he was taken to a hospital for an undisclosed surgery that he refused to consent to.” He noted that he was tied to a bed after waking up. His liver and lung had been partially removed.<br><br>Later he continued to be tortured. “He staged a hunger strike in 2006, which saw him transferred to a hospital again and told he required another surgery.”<br><br>“He asked to use the toilet and a guard freed him and escorted him to a bathroom. When they returned, the officer forgot to re-shackle his hands and feet, offering Mr. Cheng an opportunity to escape.<br><br>He fled to the United States in 2020. “American doctors who examined and tested him discovered that half of his left lung was missing, as well as two segments of his liver.<br><br>“His extraordinary testimony has offered a disturbing insight into the fates endured by those jailed on trumped up charges or as a result of persecution.”",0,2025-03-27T00:11:09Z,0

@hsuaan,"와... 대박…울어서 말도 못 하고...<br><br>The story line I understand is, two wolves, (or stray dogs?) They lived freely in the wild, living freely in this world in their crazy but happy way, without any restraints. They were family members and relied on each other. When the end came, they escaped together, but the exit was sealed. Hyunjin rushed out first. Wanting to exchange his own live for Chan&#39;s safety, so they were forced to separate. Chan desperately wanted to find Hyunjin. Later, the chain of fate led them to find each other. After reuniting, they decided to face danger together in exchange for a chance to escape. Although there are chains and shackles, they are not tied together, but Chan and Hyunjin are hold their hands together as if the chains and shackles are tied together, so their lives are also tied together, because they are the most important existence to each other.<br><br>All in all, the director did a crazy great job, and the eyes and movements of Chan and Hyunjin are also very detailed! ! Especially the way the two of them are running, rolling, climbing and playing in the first scene, and the last scene when they see the danger coming, Hyunjin’s hostile eyes are just like a real wild wolf, Chan’s fearful but determined eyes and the subconscious action of grabbing their chains tightly, the acting skills are amazing...ALSO! ! After the two held each other&#39;s hands at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvCmsOWPwKA&amp;t=177"">2:57</a>, Hyunjin said silently: Ready? And Chan seemed to respond: 가자!! Goosebumps..미쳤다..I love it soooooooooo much<br><br>The above are purely my guesses and understandings, and the facts may be completely different from what I saidㅋㅋㅋ🙏🏻<br><br>(미치겠다 나 뮤직비디오 하나에 이렇게 길게 댓글 달아본 적 없어 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ)",0,2025-03-26T18:40:52Z,0

@666BangBang,"They are like two dogs 🐶🐶 that just escaped and are playing together in that closed place. You can notice their joy at first, like when dogs play with each other, pushing each other, getting into mischief <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvCmsOWPwKA&amp;t=52"">0:52</a> , but there are people who try to lock them up when they escape. That&#39;s why they lock Hyunjin up. Like a pack, Hyunjin and Bangchan have a special connection, it&#39;s another kind of connection, like a chain that unites them, a brotherhood <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvCmsOWPwKA&amp;t=142"">2:22</a> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvCmsOWPwKA&amp;t=168"">2:48</a>, but it&#39;s not the same as the chains that restrict them. In the end, that truck is like those who look for stray dogs to take them to the dog pound, but they face it. If you look at their performances taking into account that they are like two puppies, then all my respect to our kids! Their performances were incredible! And the concept is incredible considering how much they both love their pets! 💗<br><br>💗🐶💗🐶💗🐶<br><br>Ellos son como dos perros 🐶🐶 que se acaban de escapar y juguetean juntos en ese lugar cerrado. Se puede notar su alegría en un principio, como cuando los perros juegan entre ellos, empujándose, haciendo travesuras <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvCmsOWPwKA&amp;t=52"">0:52</a> , pero hay personas que buscan encerrarlos cuando se escapan.  Por eso encierran a Hyunjin. Como una manada, tienen una conexión especial Hyunjin y Bangchan, es otro tipo de conexión,  como una cadena que los une, una hermandad <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvCmsOWPwKA&amp;t=142"">2:22</a> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvCmsOWPwKA&amp;t=168"">2:48</a>, pero no es igual a las cadenas que los restringen. El final ese camión es como los que buscan perritos para llevarlos a las perreras, pero ellos lo enfrentan. Si miran sus actuaciones tomando en cuenta que son como dos cachorros, entonces todos mis respetos a nuestros niños! les salió increíble sus actuaciones! Y el concepto es increíble tomando en cuanta cuánto quieren ellos dos a sus mascotas! 💗",3,2025-03-26T07:03:35Z,1

@wb435,"Jesus is coming back soon! The Bible foretold all of the things that are happening in the world right now over 2,000 years ago. The world will soon fall into the 7 year tribulation, which is going to be literal hell on earth. Everything is coming together exactly like God said it would! Yes, for the world it is a hopeless situation, but the good news is that God has provided an escape through faith in Jesus Christ alone! <br>     John 3:16: “For God so loved the world that he gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him will not perish, but have everlasting life.”<br>      We are all born sinners and doomed to spend eternity in hell. Romans 3:10 states that “There is no one righteous, not even one”. <br>     Romans 3:23 explains: “For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.” We all have a sin debt that we owe God and it is so great that we can never possibly repay it. However, the good news is that Jesus paid that debt by dying and suffering the wrath of God in our place on the cross, and three days later He rose from the dead in ultimate victory over sin and death. <br>     Romans 6:23 says: “The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.” God loves us more than we can even imagine and is offering every single person forgiveness and salvation, regardless of what anyone has done, if only they put their faith in Jesus Christ alone. We can never do anything to earn salvation no matter how good of a person that we think we are. Isaiah 64:6 states: “all our righteous acts are like filthy rags”. But praise God that when we accept Christ as our savior, Jesus gives us His righteousness! It’s a GIFT! <br>     Romans 10:9-10 explains: “That if you confess with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved.” <br>     Romans 10:13 “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved”. <br><br>     Jesus IS Lord and the Bible says one day all will confess that and bow their knee before Him. Unfortunately, there will be many that do that right before they go into eternal torment in the lake of fire. Do it now before it is too late! Jesus is real, He is the Son of God, He gave His life for us, and three days later He rose from the dead. To this day there is an empty tomb in Jerusalem! He is coming back soon to rapture every true believer. Don’t be left behind to experience the wrath of God that’s about to fall on this world. Get saved now before it’s too late! John 14:6: (Jesus speaking) “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.”<br><br>Here are a couple links for further information.

@lollypopangel123,"WERESKZOOS are now a thing. <br>I noticed at the start they had more animal traits in their behaviours. The way Hyunjin was in the shopping trolley he&#39;s lazing like a ferret. Then the feathers &amp; when he is on the ground in the sand, Chan is laying still &amp; Hyunjin is moving his legs in the dirt, its like a sensory play, I have seen videos of ferrets in tubs of dried pasta &amp; ball pits as a play.  Chan was in guard mode like a wolf.<br>The footprints are wolf and ferret.<br>The chains were for protection. Happens a lot in werewolf movies/stories they chain themselves up on a full moon to protect others.  Hyunjin locked him self away to be protected.  Chan was a bit more in control with the full moon &amp; on sentry mode as alpha of the pack.<br>Also CHAN MULLET.. YESSSS",0,2025-03-25T11:52:32Z,0

@Katony89,"So the story is... they are connected like a pack (ferret and wolf) ferral, aggressive and loyal. Connected. Then there&#39;s some enemy that wants to contain them. Chan sees it and tries to grab Hyunjin and run. But they get cornered so Hyunjin decides to fight with the weapon Chan gave him, sacrificing himself so Chan can run. Hyunjin gets captured,  Chan is looking for him. Hyunjin escapes (through a shared connection to the moon?) They reconnect in time to face the forces together.

Hyunjin is trapped by something that Bangchan is not(Bangchan can literally touch the chains/ bounds but they are not attached to him)? Do you not see that? I cannot tell if he wants to try and break him out a 2nd time but this time illegally different from Red lights? He showed the bounds in red lights, but it seems more urgent now. Bangchan is a producer,songwriter, and lyricist would he really make a red lights 2.0 for no reason?",1,2025-03-25T06:09:58Z,0

@yueliangmei12,"About the MV story, the plan from the start is to escape together. You will notice that there&#39;s a shadow trying to follow them and they got cornered, HJ then decided to fight to keep BC safe. You can see BC looks so worried, he was like brother no! haha anyway, he went to the top to see what happened to HJ and saw that HJ got caught (now in prison) but by the power vested on them by the moon (sailor moon haha) HJ escaped, BC saw that and they run as fast to each other (hugs). They have decided to fight whoever is in that car (bring it on) and escape together. <br><br>What do you guys think? This is just how I understand it. Also, can you believe SKZ gave us another 4 MVs? Like for normal comeback of other idol they only get 1-2 MVs but us, after getting 8 videos for their solo songs we got another 4. Thank you SKZ and SKZgi! You guys worked so hard! and your hard work shows! Congrats! Happy anniversary our eight.",2,2025-03-25T05:24:10Z,0

The 04 songs is a story!!<br>1.	BURNING TIRES: speaks about AMBITION: It is about their debut, their dreams on the beginning among many Kgroups<br>2.	TRUMAN: speaks about CONFIDENCE: in what state of mind they conceived their albums, it is so heartwarming as it is represented by the two most vulnerable SKZ members (Han &amp;Felix), the way they are represented as Jewels (see the 4th picture on the album for Truman) tells it all..<br>3.	ESCAPE: speaks about STRUGGLE: what they have to deal with, the chains, the pains, and how they managed to find each others, help each others to face the hates and criticisms and keep moving forward.. (OMG am crying)<br>4.	CINEMA: The present day, the beginning of something new ..I think it will be ultimate message to STAY, the link of all 04 songs … I can’t wait to see the M/V..

@Echoing_straykids,"OKAY SO THIS WAS A LITERAL MOVIE AND THE MUSIC WAS FIRE<br>ik i&#39;m late but here&#39;s my interpretion of the acting done:<br>so I think bangchan and hyunjin both lost something/someone they love so they bonded over trauma and grew close.  Like the tension is so there as if they&#39;re each other&#39;s lives because they&#39;re just obsessed with what they had and now they have nothing except each other. they&#39;re like...best friends but sworn brothers. only they both know each other&#39;s obsession and don&#39;t hide with each other. its like play fights between dogs yk. at the end, I think both of them just became more obsessed by losing what they had and then finding a person to share it with. they&#39;re wanted or hallucinating that they&#39;re wanted so they keep escaping. they&#39;re so tired of it that they just try to leave everything behind.",0,2025-03-25T03:56:03Z,0

@sousouchiboub7364,"Okey, Chan and Hyunjin appear to be jumping from what looks like a wall as if they&#39;ve escaped from somewhere. It seems like they&#39;re fighting each other, which I don&#39;t think is entirely accurate. Then, we see Hyunjin cutting the red threads that tie him in &quot;red lights&quot;, symbolizing liberation and escape.<br><br>One of the interesting things is that there&#39;s a scene that resembles the one in &#39;Red Lights.&#39; The second <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvCmsOWPwKA&amp;t=52"">0:52</a> looks like the scene from &quot;Red Lights&quot; In the second <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvCmsOWPwKA&amp;t=21"">0:21</a> There are many hints and references to the previous song. It appears that they&#39;ve managed to escape from whoever or whatever was holding them captive in &#39;Red Lights.&#39; We see how their fight turns into playfulness and laughter in the bed scene, where we see a part of the &#39;Red Lights&#39; clip. The restraints that once controlled them are now broken and they become free to celebrate their freedom.<br><br>Everything seems fascinating to them because it&#39;s their first time experiencing the outside world. The scene where Chan breaks the glass and gives the shard to Hyunjin has multiple interpretations, but I won&#39;t deny that my initial thought was that it symbolized ending the pain if it was the only option left. But no cause in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvCmsOWPwKA&amp;t=106"">1:46</a> we see that Chan did everything to protect Hyunjin. <br><br>Then, we see how they destroy everything in their path, symbolizing their rebellion against that world. However, those &#39;monsters&#39; (the haunting thoughts, desires, and temptations) continue to pursue them. Hyunjin, who chooses to fight and sacrifice himself instead of escaping, gets captured again. It may seem overly dramatic, but I couldn&#39;t help but connect his captivity in the song to his hiatus from the group&#39;s activities in 2021.<br><br>Chan appears desperate, unable to save Hyunjin, but ultimately, they manage to overcome their struggles and reunite. The scene where they run towards each other and hugging is one of the most beautiful moments in the video.<br><br>There are also multiple references to werewolves throughout the video, from the footprints to the full moon and the reddened moon, followed by the appearance of werewolves in the scene where they run towards each other. It was breathtaking.<br><br>I&#39;d like to mention that in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvCmsOWPwKA&amp;t=168"">2:48</a> when the image from this scene was released, many people interpreted it as a sign of control as if one of them was running away from the other and wouldn&#39;t be able to escape. However, upon watching the video and seeing the context of the scene, it became clear that Chan&#39;s grip on the chain wasn&#39;t a form of control, but rather a sign of fear - fear of losing Hyunjin again.<br><br>At that moment, as they face the car, Hyunjin&#39;s expression seems normal, while Chan&#39;s face is filled with fear and desperation. Ultimately, if they have to face something, they&#39;ll face it together. The ending seems open, leaving room for interpretation. Perhaps the car doesn&#39;t contain enemies, but rather the other members who have come to rescue them.<br><br>Keep in mind that my analysis is purely speculative, and I&#39;m discussing Chan and Hyunjin from a fraternal perspective. <br>Long way to say I&#39;m  in love❤🖤",1,2025-03-25T03:53:01Z,0

@andreastrom6106,Wait so they&#39;re like escaped werewolves? Maybe more of a smoke wolf or spirit wolf? Either way they embodied the playfulness and destruction a wild wolf would do to a pillow and food😂😂. Brother wolves who lost each other then found each other would totally embrace tightly and yeah face their captors together and fight to be free. I know the songs words lead us to imagine a bl drama...which I think if these two ever starred in one would be a smash hit. Either interpretation is good for me i like both sci fi stuff and bl dramas 😁,0,2025-03-25T02:49:38Z,0

@Atrushiiii_12,"In my opinion the best thing about being a STAY is the fact that we can get snippets of songs and demos that are unreleased. Other idols can&#39;t do that, partly because spoilering songs takes away a lot of excitement from the fans about the song(s), and partly because they don&#39;t have those demos and/or songs under their nose all the time because they don&#39;t really entirely produce their own music. Another thing could be that they actually, genuinely love their fans and everything they tell STAYs or say about us is true. I&#39;m not saying that other idols don&#39;t actually love their fans, but certainly some of them don&#39;t[actually love their fans], and that&#39;s completely fine because some behaviors and actions of certain fans can be a total turn off. In conclusion being a STAY is amazing totally recommend it.<br><br>Hope that helped.&lt;33",1,2025-03-25T02:19:03Z,0

@Castiel_May,"Started out surviving alone, met each other and fought immediately because everyone is a threat, right? But turns out they&#39;re actually not and surprisingly ended up bonding, no longer alone in this world. Then when the darkness comes and takes one away, the other one is there to help pull him back out and they fight it together. The darkness is always gonna be there but it&#39;s best to have someone on your side and look out for each other",0,2025-03-25T01:48:34Z,0

It&#39;s good when there is such a place (a training ground) where you can escape and which you can smash until you&#39;re stupefied, without harming anyone, when it&#39;s completely unbearable in a normally &quot;regular&quot; reality. Everything that happens inside doesn&#39;t leak out, like locked safely behind a prison fence from which you can&#39;t get out before your time. And it would be better if there were someone there, tied to you tightly, with a chain or a short leash, or by the full moonlight, it doesn&#39;t matter, it&#39;s about the chosen roles, which you can change periodically)) kh... not a very cozy, but a safe lair, where your moon rules and there is no place for &quot;foreign&quot; (hands).",0,2025-03-25T01:29:20Z,0

Chan and Hyunjin did an amazing job at describing a couple running away before being caught with one scarifying themself for the other. But the HUG. OMG IT WAS PERFECT. I’ve seen other people saying the same thing, but that hug looked real. It looked like a long lost couple finding each other and hugging while breaking down into tears. It was intimate, raw, and emotional. Amazing job Chan and Hyunjin, you did amazing!",1,2025-03-25T00:35:32Z,0

It&#39;s been a long time since I&#39;ve seen something so beautiful among MV videos (especially in the k-pop industry). STRAY KIDS&#39; creativity is really unpredictable, as many say.

@elizabethmeyer1922,"I’m not seeing many people talking about the depth to the song and MV…. This song disguised in tension, is a heart wrenching cry. Madness disguised as hope, since hope seems no longer to exist. The only was not to drown is to change. As much as they are fighting and achieving, it doesn’t feel like winning. Because they are still surrounded by the madness and darkness. Evil flirts with them on the daily, whether in relationship, the industry, or their own souls.",823,2025-03-24T23:28:19Z,21

@ayymie,"They represent two sides of the same person and uniting a passionate crazy side and calmer responsible reasoning side. AN INTERPRETATION. <br><br>They encounter each other with some conflict, running in the same direction but also hindering/opposing each other, then they struggle directly but enjoy it and realize they like each other, one side is happy goofing around and the other watching/protecting from above, notices the threat/obstacle and wants to get away, tries to subdue the crazy side (hand over mouth), but the crazy side decides act up and is locked away, calm side is left separated and missing the other, calls to a mutual inspiration/purpose that binds them together and they both respond to (moon), which gives them power, and then they chose unite as one person (the embrace) realizing they are more powerful/better united together, and finally they encounter the obstacle, and instead of the reasoning side leading the way, he drops the chain and hold hands with his crazy side to face it together and attack it head on utilizing both sides equally.",0,2025-03-24T23:16:39Z,0

@BrynChilders,"It&#39;s so interesting to see this concept come to life. Alot of STAYS have been saying this is red lights part 2.0 and I have to agree. Chan has said before that Red lights is the idea of a toxic relationship that you find yourself wanting to stay in. This (Escape) almost feels like the continuation of that, addressing it head-on and trying to escape the parts of yourself individually, that make you toxic for your partner, before you can come together and face the outcome. Makes me wonder if this is really a part of a trio, and we will get a third song eventually that resolves the &quot;conflict&quot; and/or they walk away peacefully from the &quot;relationship&quot;.",0,2025-03-24T22:48:39Z,0

Because in the red lights MV they looked trapped and in this MV they look like they are fighting to escape like the chains the movements the empty abandoned warehouse?! And when they were in the snow they looked happy, like they escaped the red lights MV maybe these are connected? It also looked like they were running from something maybe the eprson who trapped them and chained them up like in the red lights MV????",0,2025-03-24T22:22:59Z,0

@juliahwangg,"Plot of the Escape MV<br>Bang Chan and Hyunjin are werewolves<br>We see paw prints on the ground. They move like wolves.<br>They live in solitude, hiding from everyone<br>Bang Chan is the eldest, he has accepted himself. Hyunjin is the youngest. He still cannot accept his werewolf nature<br>Previously, during the full moon, Hyunjin chained himself up and was afraid of the transformation<br>Bang Chan always tried to protect him. He taught him how to defend himself and fight<br>But this time, everything went differently. The full moon and the approaching shadows symbolize the oncoming transformation<br>At first, Bang Chan grabs Hyunjin&#39;s hand and runs to hide him, as always<br>But Hyunjin frees his nature, he is tired of hiding, he runs, he is ready<br>Bang Chan running towards him and smiling widely. He is happy that Hyunjin finally let himself go<br>They both turn into wolves<br>In the end, we see that both characters are confident, strong and fearless",0,2025-03-24T22:15:06Z,0

Also, in &quot;GIANT -korean ver.-&quot;, there&#39;s a part &quot;I just work hard like a little ant, I overcame the pain and became a giant&quot; and there&#39;s exact same lyrics in &quot;ULTRA&quot;(Changbin&#39;s solo).

And your guys vocals are amazing and I’m proud of how far you’ve come even when you struggled a lot you still had a positive energy and powered through it and you’ve had a huge impact on us stays.,0,2025-03-24T21:27:00Z,0

@CheZzzbroc,"There’s something so intimate about the characters they’re playing, their bond is so tight yet they’re separated time and time again by what seems to be some organization. The characters are implied to be werewolves I feel, and the organization is keeping them captive, so they’re trying to escape their cages and be with each other again. I love this concept, it’s something very different yet similar to Red Lights and I think when Chan and Hyunjin bind their minds together they always come up with something extravagant and beautiful.",1,2025-03-24T21:26:41Z,0

@Elle.1527,"My interpretation of the MV is that it represents Chan always looking out for the group and how they all started.<br><br>At the beginning, they are running wild and free (symbolizing their time before debut). Then, Hyunjin is sitting in the shopping cart—just like how we, as fans (STAY), chose them. But you can see the dragging of feet while pulling the cart and Hyunjin drawing on the ground—this represents the struggle of carrying something heavy. It’s as if he’s shackled and chained, trying to draw boundaries, but he eventually breaks free from those restraints. He throws away the burning stick, symbolizing his release from past issues.",0,2025-03-24T21:26:24Z,6

@zuja734,"Call me crazy, but I have a theory that these 4 Mixtape M/Vs are actually an apocalyptic series 🤯 <br>1. It started with Changbin and I.N living in utopian world and taking part in a real-life video game full of life threating acrobatics (like an Black Mirror episode), trying to win money/trophy. They need to win no matter what it takes and how much it&#39;s tiring. They&#39;re BURNING TIRES and tyres. We seem them trying to navigate through the game while being observant to others (like that caterpillar). After winning they returned to their regular life, only to be punished for a speeding ticket.<br>2. Then Han and Felix&#39;s world showed underworld in a cult society. They had to be true to themselves, they had to be TRU MAN, and their liberation from prison pushed that society to anarchy and destruction.<br>3. Chan and Hyunjin now play a pair in world on fire -  crazy times, where only being together keeps them sane and gives them energy to finally ESCAPE from everyone that wants to hurt them.<br>Prediction 4. CINEMA will be about Lee Know and Seungmin living in a dystopian society, hoping to find little pieces of happiness in the world that remains and them reminiscing about their past lives, feeling like their life was a movie, an absolute CINEMA.<br><br>Again, call me crazy.

@llemon-u6h,"4am thoughts<br>someone mentioned that hyunjin is a white ferret &amp; chan is black/grey wolf, so I watch the mv again with that pov. at the beginning of the mv it shows that hyunjin is on his own &amp; kind of &#39;wild&#39;. and it looks like chan is preying on/searching for something. but then he found hyunjin &amp; maybe he &#39;adopt &amp; tame&#39; him (the part where chan pushed hyujin against the glass etc) until hyunjin become gentle. they started become close, like brothers, playing around together. the part where chan gives hyunjin a piece of glass might indicate like weapon to protect himself or sth im not really sure about this part.<br><br>at the part &#39;escape this reality.. ill fulfil your fantasies&#39; chan was smiling while looking at hyunjin who was having fun by himself (i love this part so much cs it portray like pure innocent joy). chan here looks like a guardian or protector keeping watch over hyunjin. <br><br>but then he sensed danger coming &amp; quickly grabbed hyunjin to hide. but hyunjin take the weapon, the glass, and charged towards the &#39;danger&#39;, leaving chan behind. hyunjin might be captured by the &#39;danger&#39; (the part where hyunjin was alone in a room with metal chains around his body). chan proceed to hide &amp;  wanting to rescue hyunjin, he &#39;summon the full moon&#39; to get powers (i think hshshsh) and the part where the chains on hyunjin started floating, maybe answering the call of chan&#39;s power (I&#39;m making my own theory here haha) &amp; he succeed to escape from the danger (where he and chan finally reunited &amp; hug).<br><br>then, the danger (the truck) comes again &amp; hyunjin and chan holding hands showing that they will fight &amp; escape from the danger together. <br><br>this is my interpretation of the mv. could be very wrong tho hahaha. <br><br>ps: when someone mentioned about the ferret &amp; wolf, i was imagining a real ferret &amp; wolf (maybe jiniret and wolfchan) playing tgt and it was so cute i couldn&#39;t get the picture out of my mind❤",3,2025-03-24T20:45:19Z,0

Love, love, love ... these guys, their creativity, again, chemistry, those intangibles and talent that ooze from the screen.  Stray Kids don&#39;t disappoint.  I&#39;m so glad this came out today.  I&#39;ve been waiting!  Haha ... the other Kids videos are amazing, as well.  Concert in Atlanta on my calendar, tickets bought ... my second Stray Kids concert.  How lucky am I???!!!

@giggleloop13,"So far my interpretation of the Escape MV is that Chan is already a werewolf, and Hyunjin is acting as if he&#39;s going thru the change for the first time. They were previously chained together but although they&#39;ve broken the chain, they stayed together. Chan gives Hyun the piece of broken glass as if offering him a way out, but after an internal struggle, he chooses Chan instead. They run towards each other at the climax (their animal forms appearing briefly) and as they collide and embrace, they&#39;re suddenly both wearing fur coats, suggesting that Hyun has changed too. An enemy appears and they join hands, choosing to bind themselves, choosing to escape together.",0,2025-03-24T20:37:58Z,0

I watched their journey from their trainee days—at first, they fought to survive, then they learned to share both hardships and joy. Over time, they sacrificed for one another, bound by a love stronger than fear. And in the end, they stood side by side, unshaken, defying the cruelty of the world with unwavering loyalty and an unbreakable bond of friendship.",46,2025-03-24T20:33:39Z,0

@HanQuokkaCore,The way I see this is there both wolf&#39;s that got captured and they&#39;ve been trying to escape from being chained up all the time they finally got out and have been watching each other&#39;s backs taking care of each other. And the ending that&#39;s the person that has had them chained up and they grab each other&#39;s hands and go fight to get away. But how ever you interpret it. It is still an amazing song and m/v! I love it and it&#39;s so good! They did such a geart job on it!,1,2025-03-24T20:27:55Z,0

@yikesyuu,"i have my own analysis for the mv:<br>Hyunjin is a beast who cannot trust anyone as he&#39;s been treated horribly before. Chan wants to help him by taming him and making him trust him (as you can see he was trying to bring him under control by throwing him around) As soon as they trust each other, the previous owner that hyunjin ran away from starts chasing him down and when they were cornered, hyunjin protected chan and sacrificed himself by getting caught. Chan then searches for him and frees him and they united (the hug). At the end they both got caught and face the evil owner head on. <br><br><br>I&#39;m sorry for the horrible explanation. That&#39;s the best I could do 😭",1,2025-03-24T19:45:50Z,0

Hyunjin embodies the addict, trapped in a cycle he can&#39;t escape, while Bang Chan personifies the drug—luring him in with promises of relief but pulling him deeper into despair. The aesthetics, acting, and the dark atmosphere convey that sense of being trapped in an endless cycle, showing how hard it is to break free from something that consumes you.

@Bangchiggitychansupermercy,"Bro I’m fully convinced that in Red Lights Hyunjin was trying to escape from Bangchan as in that MV we mostly see Hyunjin in chains and during Red Ligjta there’s a part where Hyunjin has Chan in a hold by his neck signaling that he was close to getting away but couldn’t. At the end of Red Lights they’re looking into two different mirrors which means Hyunjin must’ve finally gotten away which leads us into Escape. In Escape Hyunjin gets himself caught again but Chan is treating him differently. They get close and form a close friendship together and throughout he doubts Chan and feels like he’s being manipulated but Chan has no bad intentions or so we think. Hyunjin and Chan find themselves facing something bigger and Hyunjin looks at Chan to encourage him but little does he know he’s just leading himself back into Red Lights. Back into NOEASY, back into that mansion, that room, those chains and back to Chan.",4,2025-03-24T18:57:38Z,0

@boogiewoogie4047,"OMG I  forever destroyed! The part where Chan said “In exchange for the pain, can you promise me to show your love for me everyday?” And when he said “let me take you to a place that nobody even knows. Them shackles and them chains, you’re free to take them off” I died. I have never seen a more powerful expression of raw emotion.",0,2025-03-24T18:45:06Z,0

@NoorShafiya2004,"I honestly feel like crying cus this kind of gives me a feeling that this talks about toxic relationships.<br><br>Like bangchan saying in return for this pain, give yourself to me. Like hes saying he&#39;ll inflict pain as a reward for hyunjin always making himself available. Like kind if punishing him for being a victim. But making it seem like love.<br><br>And the references to red lights in the mattress scene when theyre happy and playing around is like showing that underneath all those happy moments, the abuse is waiting to happen. Cus red lights kinda talks about going into the deep end of your temptations.<br><br>The scene where bangchan gives hyunjin the piece of glass is like him giving him a piece of his vulnerability.<br><br>Also the scene where they run, you can see bangchan cover hyunjins mouth. Silencing him, like how abusers silence their victims (usually under the guise of protecting them) and then hyunjin runs away with chans vulnerability.<br><br>The scene of hyunjin alone, it seems like hes trying to cut the chains off using chans vulnerability (the piece of glass)<br>And bangchan is kinda like looking for him because abusers also depend on their victims so bangchan is looking for him desperately.<br><br>And then finally its like the chains are dragging them back to each other. And the hug is very emotional as its them reuniting after a falling out. And then its like when theyre running to each other you can see theyre potrayed in like an animalistic form. Kinda like the bond is animalistic and primal with each other.<br>After they reunite you can see the truck, its like the outsiders and the headlights are kinda like them exposing their toxicity. And theyre deciding to fight against it together. (Shown by charging against it) Kinda shows how both the abuser and victim of toxic relationships defend their &quot;love&quot;<br><br>Its also the overall references...like chasing each other. Being violent towards each other. Being playful. The occasional tender moments. The chains. And the first scene where they run and one kicks the barrel of fire that turns everything red. Kinda like showing how its when one hurts the other that the flaws in their relationship are brought out (shown by turning red) and then the lyrics saying how you can free the chains and shackles whenever you want. Kinda how you can logically leave a toxic relationship if you want but its actually not that easy.<br><br>Hyunjin describing chan as a devil by the phrase &quot;devils gestures&quot; saying theres so many reasons to be ruined by him (like how victims usually find reasons to stay with their abusers)<br><br>Hyunjin saying he&#39;d burn himself to melt away chan&#39;s coldness (cold-heartness...kinda like the I can fix him vibe that toxic relationships give)<br><br>Also the scene where hyunjin kinda goes psycho with the breaking the shopping cart and everything and chan admiring it kinda shows how the narcissist kinda influences 5he victim to the point that they&#39;d pick up their narcissistic and abusive ways as well.<br><br>That scene following the scene where chan gives him his vulnerability (the glass piece) shows the closeness they reach before hyunjin decided to run away and then they reunite.Ultimately showing that the vicious cycle continues. <br><br>After reuniting, you can see in the shot of their hands . It seems as if theyre chained together again. But when you look closer ,you can see channie is holding hyunjinnie&#39;s chain. Kinda showing how the abuser once again has the victim in their control.<br><br>I just love the depth of the song, lyrics ,beat and the metophorical scenes in this MV.<br><br>Just speaks to me as a person who&#39;s been in a toxic relationship. <br><br>Thank you bangchan and hyunjin for this beautiful masterpiece and for making me feel heard. ❤❤❤❤",0,2025-03-24T18:43:01Z,0

@chukovskaya,"I&#39;ve already read many theories and interpretations of Escape. Dramatic, erotic, fantasy, highly social, etc. But for me, the clip is not about the romantic part of love at all. It&#39;s about the great relief that &quot;you and I are of the same blood&quot; and &quot;I&#39;m not alone.&quot; <br><br>A man lives, keeps a &quot;wolf&quot; in himself. There&#39;s another one, with a smaller predator inside. Maybe each of them thought that he was the only one in the world who was completely different from the others, &quot;wrong&quot;, lonely - but then they found each other. They found out. And they didn&#39;t scare each other off. And the chains of restraint and mimicry under the &quot;norm&quot; have broken, because there is no longer any need to hold back and pretend. No point to hide the real face and the view of the world. Fun, crazy, free. Together. Maybe for the first time in his  lifes. And they&#39;re either being chased or followed. Whether it&#39;s public opinion with censure, or the Winchester brothers with stern faces. Chan wants to protect and hide, Hwang wants to protect and drive everyone away. And then one rushes into a fight, while the other, meanwhile, is looking for shelter - and misses the moment when the smaller one rushes. So far, Chan have climbed up to figure out where to look - Hwang is already on a chain, pining, in a damp dungeon. He shakes violently and squeezes a piece of glass. And when the X-Files started altogether and the chains took off by themselves, both rushed to save the other. All at once, without hesitation. And these hugs are also a huge relief, &quot;I&#39;m in time&quot;! <br><br>And there - the headlights, the fever in the blood, the hand in the hand and the look &quot;Together?&quot; - &quot;To the end!&quot; And - fighting. They will find out about victory or defeat later, the main thing is that they will no longer give up and will not hide. <br><br>And it&#39;s the kind of story that makes my heart beat faster. Finding each other and being on the same side is priceless. <br><br>I love this clip.",0,2025-03-24T17:55:38Z,0
@nayd.k.4364,"Those who say that wolves are the most unhinged carnivore animals never met a feral ferret. When they run, they run like an arrow, when they play, they are fast and slick, if they attack, they throw all their body in, and once they clawed in, can take down a much larger enemy. But when threatened they can resort back to burrowing. And the thing with burrows is they only have one way in and no way out. So if the threat chases you down and waits at the door, you can&#39;t leave. That at least until someone distracts it. Maybe someone you&#39;ve played with before",0,2025-03-24T17:55:33Z,0

@LaDitSky,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvCmsOWPwKA&amp;t=81"">1:21</a> Here is the development of relations. No kidding. When Chan gives Hyunjin a piece of glass (in the shape of a fang), it is a gift. From that moment on, they become more united. This is shown in contrast to how they fought and had fun up to this point, and after that moment they escape together from some shadows and are already united. The parallel with the aquarium of Romeo and Juliet, I think, just says that they achieve romance in this part.  It&#39;s so beautiful and deeply soulful 😢",0,2025-03-24T17:50:38Z,0

@melody1953,"So they&#39;re sort of werewolves/just wolves/have wolf form power, and they might be connected in a way, based on how they reacted when Hyunjin decided to head towards the danger (it looked like he was trying to protect Chan/let him escape TT or at least find an way out of the trap situation) and Chris climbed up the tour using or awakening their powers through/against the red light of the moon. It looks like Chan was struggling when the red light shone upon him, but then he tried to control it with his hand/power and a red moon formed or got revealed from the darkness. Then, Hyunjin felt something happening and he lifted his hand, and he noticed he lifted his chains too. So they decided to find each other again and face ahead what&#39;s blocking or chasing them. In the end, they escaped in a way or another, but fighting together. There&#39;s broken glass at the end, including the piece they had picked up to fight/defend themselves soooooooooooooooo I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t wanna think they died or lost, so let&#39;s just stay on the fact they decided to face the danger together, holding hands. <br><br>After rewatching the mv, it&#39;s true they act a bit like wolves/animals playing together, not caring as much about the violence of their way of playing (as if they&#39;re tough enough to tank/endure the throwing around and all), rolling and climbing around, breaking thinks, etc. They also got interested in the gold fishes they found, but it might be because they were red and this color plays a role in this story. It might be why they smashed the fish tank down, to try to catch the fish as it&#39;s red. After breaking it, they don&#39;t find or grab any red fish, but they pick up a piece of the broken glass, finding a tool to fight or defend themselves if needed. It&#39;s like a step toward their freedom. The color red looks like is linked to what&#39;s chasing them, but also seems to be the key of either their way out or their powers.",0,2025-03-24T17:48:00Z,0

@Kiats_lvs_Jeongin,"This music video has left me speechless...<br> There are many things that reminded me of old/recent music videos or songs, like Red Lights, Railway, and Wolfgang. I swear, I was really surprised by the beginning, seeing them run like wolves, climbing everywhere, and breaking free from their chains it&#39;s all so impressive. Also, the hug between Hyunjin and Bangchan killed me, oh my god, what kind of amazing madness is this? There’s so much tension, and I love it, I adore how their voices sound both together and individually. Chan’s high note made me levitate, seeing his stunning visuals made me fall in love, everything is so good. The MV’s editing is really cool, the song&#39;s lyrics are amazing, it makes me want to escape to another reality or just be free. But I also loved the heavy rhythm, the sets, and the powerful moments between Hyunjin and Bangchan. Oh my god, this MV is everything that’s right in this world and it deserves so many views because the guys truly outdid themselves. This duo never disappoints, and they’re amazing. I loved everything, and I’m sure I’ll spend the whole day listening to &quot;Escape.&quot;<br>🔥✨🔥✨🔥✨🔥✨🔥✨🔥✨🔥",10,2025-03-24T17:44:22Z,2

@subahzareenkhanam7125,"HYUNCHAN <b>NEVER</b> DISAPPOINTS!!!!!<br><br>LIKE------- I will NEVER NOT LOVE a HyunChan song cuz they be casually making the most complex storylines and turning em into banger songs. The MVs are no less stunning and the ACTING????? THAT&#39;S ACE SHI- RIGHT THERE.<br><br> I absolutely adore the concept this time and how neatly it ties to Railway. (We see you Chris...) And ofcourse however could we miss the Red Light reference?~~~ Just two wolves breaking off all restraints and fleeing from the endlessly greedy world and yet they are ever so tightly binded to each-other. And as they said in Red Lights-  &quot;You know well the fact that I can&#39;t leave/abandon you.&quot; They really can&#39;t. Red Lights shows the obsessive side of that attachment and Escape breaks-down how they got to that point. Even here, we can still see them fighting but in the next scenes we see them being playful and fully enjoying themselves. I would say it highlights their realization of the fact that they are one of a kind and they only have e/o to rely on, fight with, be happy with and can therefore one cannot survive without the other.",1,2025-03-24T17:20:43Z,0

@AnnaZakervashevich,"So many meanings in the song, in the M/V.<br>No matter how bad  the world is, no matter that is falling apart - above all you are stronger with someone by your side. Even you are werewolf, a wild beast. You can fight the whole world together.<br>People around you can chain you up but you can escape, together.<br>And I see here a part of real life - people expect a lot from them, always in the light. It’s hard and sometimes the pressure is too much.<br>Excellent song!!! I can&#39;t stop listening to it. The song evokes many feelings.<br>This duo is perfect!!! Wonderful vocals, acting, lyrics. Thank you for this masterpiece!! 🫰🫰🫰",0,2025-03-24T17:08:52Z,0

@thylionheart,"This MV is FASCINATING and the song is absolutely incredible! I can see the narrative of the story in the MV being interpreted a few ways. With the brief shot referencing Red Lights, it reintroduces the concept of codependency in the relationship whether that relationship is brotherly or homoerotic in nature. Red Lights is the pull and the binding, whereas ESCAPE is the stage where they don’t have to be shackled together to want to stay together.<br><br>But it could also be representative of two sides of someone’s personality or will. Red Lights is the attempt to restrain one side of yourself that you’re ashamed of while ESCAPE is the acceptance of that side.<br><br>Phenomenal and deep work as always, wow.",3,2025-03-24T16:46:59Z,0

@katkatzo,"Read a lot of wild comments before watching it. So I cleared my head and opened my mind before actually watching it and the way I see it is… at first they were enemies and eventually they become friends and team up to go against whatever is chasing them. I feel like Hyunjin was a ferret and Chan was a wolf which makes sense why they were fighting each other on the first few scenes. <br><br>Whatever it is, their acting was good. The MV is good. The lyrics of the song is actually very nice especially the line “in exchange for this pain, can you promise me to show your love for me every day” it reminds me of what they need to endure for their careers and for their fans.

@viktoria991,"I cried at the end.😢😢😢 It’s a story of REAL LOVE!!! Once, they ran alone, surviving in solitude until fate brought them together. I watched their journey from their trainee days—at first, they fought to survive, then they learned to share both hardships and joy. Over time, they sacrificed for one another, bound by a love stronger than fear. And in the end, they stood side by side, unshaken, defying the cruelty of the world with unwavering loyalty and an unbreakable bond of friendship.",347,2025-03-24T16:02:39Z,8

@Sikhindu,"There&#39;s so much going on in the video. <br><br>Without the lyrics I see two guys constantly fighting each other and life&#39;s obstacles, while going in the same direction. They have chains that match but it&#39;s not until the end when they chose to connect those chains and face the obstacles as one team rather than alone. <br><br>With the lyrics, I see two guys struggling with the drabness of life and offering each other a safe haven to take a break from it all. The lyrics say to take off the chains, meaning feel free to be one&#39;s self while with each other, yet in the video they don&#39;t take the chains off, they use them to connect with each other. <br><br>They want to offer each other a place of peace, sort of life the eye of the storm. Everything else can be messy but the two of them want to create a home in each other. <br><br>Like they said, it&#39;s a more mature version of Red Lights and I agree. This is more about  the full spectrum of a relationship rather than just few aspects of it like in Red Lights. I enjoy this upgrade. <br><br>Now just my take, it&#39;s kinda painful seeing them out there living like homeless and kinda fighting each other. I am glad the storming ended and they could finally be together sans the fighting. <br><br>There are so many metaphors in this video and in the lyrics, I have really enjoyed myself. <br><br>Also, the chains from Red Light carried over to Escape, and instead of the polished interiors that is in Red Lights, they are out here in the rough streets, in the dirty, rough, and real world. <br><br>Hyunjin and Bang Chan, I love you!",8,2025-03-24T15:52:14Z,0

They help each other in difficult times. Bang Chan&#39;s character takes care of Hyunjin&#39;s character. It seems like Hyunjin is ready to give up and stop fighting. But Bang Chan helps him.

@Cecehwnag,"Okay, I need to talk about THE HUG. When Hyunjin and Chan embraced each other, I literally felt my soul leave my body. The way they held each other wasn’t just a hug—it was like this moment of comfort, understanding, and unspoken connection that hit way harder than I expected. It felt like a visual representation of breaking free together, like they’re not just escaping physically, but emotionally, supporting each other through the chaos. It was so intimate and raw, I’m still shook. That hug honestly felt like the heart of the whole MV, like everything was leading to that one moment. 10/10 would get hugged by them if given the chance. 😭",1013,2025-03-24T15:49:43Z,8

@Cecehwnag,"Okay, after watching the ‘ESCAPE’ MV like 10 times, here are some hidden details I noticed. First, the mirror imagery is super symbolic—it’s all about self-reflection and duality, showing the internal struggles and the search for freedom. The lighting between light and shadow keeps flipping, which feels like a battle between hope and despair, totally tying into the song’s theme of escaping a fallen world. Then, the lyrics are lowkey a whole vibe—‘Let me take you to a place that nobody even knows’ and ‘Them shackles and them chains you’re free to take ‘em off’ scream freedom and breaking away from constraints. Oh, and did anyone notice the subtle references to ‘Red Lights’? Like, the visuals, energy, and even some of the settings felt like a continuation of that vibe! Lastly, there’s some hidden foreshadowing—like how the duo’s positions and movement throughout the video hint at bigger things coming, almost like they’re paving the way for future projects. I’m sure there’s more I missed, but Stray Kids really outdid themselves with this one. I’m still processing, ngl.",9,2025-03-24T15:49:22Z,0

I LITERALLY CANNOT. BUT THEN CHAN CAME IN WITH THAT ENERGY AND JUST STABBED ME IN THE HEART IN THE MOST ICONIC WAY. I’M NOT OKAY. I’M DECEASED. THESE TWO REALLY SAID “LET’S END THEIR WHOLE EXISTENCE” AND DID IT WITH NO CHILL. I’M SWEATING, I’M SHAKING, I’M LITERALLY RECONSIDERING EVERY LIFE DECISION I’VE EVER MADE.

Good story line also, the little flash scene of Red Lights was a nice touch as well. Love this duo. Need more of them. And the Beauty they both bring to this MV is Fantastic.❤ my handsome kings.

@rmlimitededition3746,"The references to wolf spirit and animalistic behaviors from both, from the start the way they ran and moved was more wolf like than human. In the abandoned factory each moved and betrayed none human behaviors as animals that had been chained and kept in the dark. when they escaped the aggressive behaviors were more dominate even with there interactions with each other. But it was almost joyous at time even though they were wresting with each other they were smiling that all this rage and angst was being set free finally. Toward the end even though they tried being apart they were stronger together. They way it appears as if they are one in the same whole, one the human side one the wolf, or that Chan is the Alpha and Hyunjin is eighter his Beta or part of his pack. I lean toward that they are part of the same pack and was separated   from the group and kept captive for whatever reason . The lyric can be taken many different ways with a dynamic of being of one person is dominate and has kept them chained to teach them be it mentally or physically or both but as time passes knows they wont leave. The lyric the chains your free to take them off and also In exchange for this pain can you promise to show your love for me everyday. Both can be taken as one party who holds the control know regardless the chains are always there that the other is submissive and loyal to them. they wont leave they will take the pain as a reward for they love they hold for the other. Their is so much you can take from both the lyrics and the visual concept of the mv. It was beautifully done and like redlights there is so many layers to it as a whole. Not just a sexy song though it can be taken in that way. But it is much deeper to it as you take in all the elements as a whole.",0,2025-03-24T15:41:30Z,0

In this case, they both have a toxic relationship again in which they are trapped (which is why it continues to be reflected with the chains) and they continue to fight against each other constantly. But, in this case, at the end we see how they both stop fighting each other to start fighting together against the problem. They hug, hold hands, and decide to escape together from that toxic relationship and build something healthier. I love them!!!❤️❤️",1,2025-03-24T15:38:13Z,0

@ivannajarvi5693,"Amazing. While I was watching I was thinking of it as a continuation and evolution of the theme of Red Lights, obsession and never wanting to stop because what&#39;s waiting on the other side of never-ending work or never-ending distraction is silence and the pain you&#39;ve been avoiding, which is what I think they&#39;re talking about here. &quot;Don&#39;t you love the sound of silence, it&#39;s all we need...&quot; brilliant because silence is the only thing that lets you connect with yourself, and face the pain, and heal it, and therefore be able to really connect with the people you love. The scenes where they run to hug each other and take each other&#39;s hands are beautiful. Really being and really being together. There&#39;s nothing better❤❤❤",2,2025-03-24T15:34:06Z,0

@宇宇-s7b,"Initially appearing as adversaries,Hyunjin awakens when Chan intrudes into his territory. As witnessed, they engage in conflict, yet mysteriously find themselves transitioning from combat to intimacy mid-battle (We all understand how this works - I know,You know,Lee know).<br><br>Subsequently developing mutual affection, Hyunjin chooses to depart this realm with Chan, only to encounter obstacles. When Hyunjin sacrifices himself to protect Chan, Chan refuses to abandon Hyunjin. Through concerted efforts, they ultimately reunite (Their emotional embrace during reunion absolutely wrecks me 😭 This will undoubtedly become my favorite MV moment of 2025).<br><br>In the poignant conclusion, they clasp matching handcuffs around their joined wrists, hands tightly interlaced as they charge courageously toward peril together. Though the finale shows shattering glass leaving their fate uncertain,the profound bond between them remains profoundly moving.",5,2025-03-24T15:23:14Z,0

@RikaMask,"Stays let&#39;s get together, I need your opinions on my theory: it also seems like a red light explanation to me, if we reread the lyrics of red light now, they told us that they could only rest when the sun rose, I can&#39;t escape, I only see red lights. Leaving aside that here they move as if they were transforming into wolves, they escape from the red lights, frames of red lights when the chains melt. According to every story, werewolves transform at the full moon and are usually trapped tied to chains. The full moon causes them pain, the red light from which they could not escape. They are freeing themselves, many scenes are references to red lights, even when HYUNJIN frees himself from the red ropes also present in red lights. When they run towards each other, you can see the animal souls, as if they were finding freedom in a pack, together, and then running towards a much desired freedom. There are also many other references to red lights. STAYs WHAT DO YOU THINK?",1,2025-03-24T15:18:03Z,0

@architectofmylife-04,"I am STUNNED!!!! There is so much happening in this music video. First of all, it looks like a really insane action movie. My interpretation: This song is about embracing all parts of yourself. Like a union within oneself. Light and dark, all coming together to become a more powerful, fearless version of yourself. The events in the MV are not chronological. <br>Chan represents the outer persona, the lighter side of your being, the side that you show to the world. Hyunjin is the darker aspect. The inner self that is rejected and hidden cause of shame and guilt. <br><br>In the beginning, you are scared and lost and shackled, you reject parts of yourselves for too long. You have no idea when that even started. Those parts remain shackled, but in pain, they keep knocking at your heart to get your attention (hyunjin, writhing, looking uncomfortable, being shackled in the dark, reaching out to the window). It starts to get noisy, the demon inside you starts acting like a maniac, breaking things, acting crazy and violent; your life starts crumbling (all the violent and psycho scenes, the opening lyrics). It gets to a point where you can&#39;t ignore the demon anymore, so you finally start looking at them, hanging out with them but it isn&#39;t easy. The demon is mad at you for ignoring it for so long, so he unleashes all of that violence on you (the fight scenes), it gets really crazy but gradually you start liking it, understanding each other, there are even moments of peace (the two of them hanging out silently, affectionately, looking at the piece of glasses, playfighting). Gradually, it starts dawning on you just how deeply trapped you have been (fishes in the aquarium), so you look at them but there&#39;s acceptance, warmth, SADNESS towards yourself like &quot;Oh MY GOD why have I been so trapped, why didn&#39;t I notice at first, and so on&quot;. Finally, you can&#39;t take it... staying trapped is no longer an option cz your back is against the wall now (them being stuck against the shutter), you try to find a way but in the same direction (chan pushing the shutter, trying to open it so they can go and hide again) but the demon that you kept shackled for so long, it becomes your power and says &quot;NO MORE&quot; and runs towards the &quot;danger/fear&quot; headfirst. And the moment that happens, you become this BEAST of a person, ready for any challenge, any danger, anything! You realise you were the only one who kept you shackled and you were always free to break free of those shackles and chains. You realise you can escape. And when you do make that escape, it is not meek... You RUN, you RUN for your LIFE! because you cannot bear to spend it like how you did before. And that&#39;s where you have full acceptance of yourself (the running and the HUG!!!!) You become ONE with yourself. And now you are not scared of any shadows, or lights, or power... come what may... and you dive into it headfirst TOGETHER hand-in-hand... (they collide into the unknown truck) fearlessly.<br><br>Also, I think the first person in this song is the inner demon (hyunjin). It&#39;s the demon singing... I can&#39;t let you go, &#39;cause the world&#39;s about to break, just follow me, i will take the lead, in exchange of this pain will you love me every day? <br><br>AHHHHH it&#39;s so so so so beautiful! I am going crazy over this song and I can&#39;t wait for the making video!!!!! Anyway, this got too long. Let me know what you guys think, if you happen to read it all.",2,2025-03-24T15:15:37Z,0

@FearMyLadyBits,"So someone mentioned that Red Lights may have been about SKZ&#39;s relationship with their fanbase, where they love performing on stage and interacting in their livestreams, but at the same time resent the judgy entitlement like what was seen at the airport a week ago. Like the fans own SKZ and have a say in their personal lives, that they can intrude on their privacy and force SKZ to interact with them. <br><br>My impression of this new mv is that even if they break away from the entertainment industry they&#39;ve been &quot;chained&quot; to for 10-15 years, they&#39;d still be hunted down by the fans who don&#39;t respect boundaries, but instead of being passive about the attacks (and even apologizing for bullying that never happened, or stupid stuff from when they were 13), they&#39;re going to start fighting back against the abuse, because that&#39;s the only way they can survive.",5,2025-03-24T15:12:49Z,1

Like they really devide in 4 groups and try to survive or Smth ) I want to understand what are the dark/shadow hands can mean . I still &quot;explore &quot; skz media , lore and etc .

I love it so much when they hug, hold hands, and the look they give each other at the end! I&#39;m really looking forward to learning more about this video.

Also in escape there&#39;s a lot of burning mentions and what colour is things that burn most of the time red so red lights, brilliant.

@yup._.piieee,"Inspired by ESCAPE – A short story: 𝙀𝙨𝙘𝙖𝙥𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝘾𝙝𝙧𝙞𝙨 by me 🌌<br><br>The sky was on fire again.<br>Sam stood barefoot in the middle of the cracked road, watching the flames devour the horizon. The air was thick with the scent of burnt steel and ash. Sirens wailed in the distance, but they sounded muffled like a memory slipping away.<br><br>“See?” Chris whispered beside him, his voice low and smooth. &quot;The world’s breaking… just like us.&quot;<br><br>Sam smiled faintly.<br>It was beautiful.<br>Chaotic.<br>Free.<br><br>Chris grabbed his hand, and together they ran through the wreckage. The city became their playground—crumbling buildings, rivers of molten glass, and streets splitting apart.<br>They sprinted through it all, laughing like madmen.<br><br>Sam’s lungs burned, but he didn’t stop.<br>Chris’s fingers tightened around his, pulling him forward.<br>Faster. Deeper.<br><br>“You feel it, right?” Chris grinned, eyes gleaming. “This is freedom. This is us.”<br><br>Sam grinned back, breathless.<br>“It is.”<br><br>Hours or minutes later—it was impossible to tell—Sam stood before a shattered window, staring at his reflection. His hair clung to his damp forehead, his eyes were bloodshot.<br>And Chris was smiling back at him.<br><br>“Don’t stop now,” Chris coaxed.<br>His voice was sweet, almost pleading. “There’s more to burn.”<br><br>Sam’s chest ached. His hands trembled slightly, but he gripped the edge of the frame, knuckles white.<br>“Let’s keep going,” he whispered.<br><br>Chris’s lips curled into a grin. “That’s my boy.”<br>They climbed higher—scaling the fire escape of a half-collapsed building. By the time they reached the rooftop, the city below was nothing but a blur of orange and black—a dying star flickering against the night.<br><br>Chris stood at the edge, arms spread wide, his hair whipping in the wind.<br>Untouchable. Unstoppable. Perfect.<br><br>“Let’s fly,” Chris whispered, his voice barely above the wind.<br>His eyes burned with fierce euphoria.<br><br>Sam’s breath caught in his throat.<br>He walked to the edge, his feet inches from oblivion.<br>He could feel the pull—the warmth of freedom calling him.<br>And he smiled.<br><br>Chris held out his hand.<br>Sam took it without hesitation.<br>Their fingers laced together—cold, steady, unshakable.<br><br>“Let’s escape,” Chris whispered.<br>And Sam closed his eyes.<br><br>When he jumped, he didn’t scream.<br>He didn’t flinch.<br>He didn’t feel the wind rushing past him.<br><br>Because Chris was still holding his hand.<br>All the way down.<br>All the way into the darkness.<br>Together.",0,2025-03-24T15:07:12Z,0

The tension was held perfectly and I truly believed it was the two of them against the world at the end. The chains that had previously trapped them in a cycle of obsession have been broken, and they&#39;re running towards an unknown future together. Although there is clearly danger in front of them, they face it with strength and determination, hand in hand.

@zaptaksimi,"Ok, so I watched the song multiple times and later in 0.8 speed. I think the story behind the MV is, they are lone wolves that are chained in by the facility(industry) where they are being held and experimented on. Now they break free and running away from that hell. In one scene, we see handprints on the facility&#39;s window (in red) which might be a sign of their captivity their and that the people are now coming to take them. So they both run to each other bcoz they know if they fight together, they can ESCAPE FROM REALITY and when they hug, they feel they are stronger together (oh! The shot of them as wolves for a split second <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvCmsOWPwKA&amp;t=155"">2:35</a> ). Now, the truck at the end can be facility/industry itself that surrounds them and they decide to fight together by holding hands and merging their power (its full moon, so they are powerful today) <br>OR <br>The truck at the end are STAYS, that shows them a bright light future and help them RUN AWAY FROM THE WORLD which they know of until now(red light facility). So both of them hold hands together and ESCAPE.",2,2025-03-24T14:59:39Z,0

@couldntshineorblink,"The concept of the music video, the atmosphere, the locations, the acting of the Hyunchan duo, all the scenes completely reflect the aggressiveness, escape struggle and emotionality of the song. It&#39;s like the thing we hold tightly to ourselves inside us is struggling to escape and get away from us, while we are tying that thing to ourselves even more, like contradiction and conflict of trying to get rid of it and trying to prevent it from escaping with our entire being. The concept is very successful in terms of depth and multiple meanings.🌑",27,2025-03-24T14:54:25Z,0

@viktoria991,"I cried at the end...😢😢 It’s a story of REAL LOVE!!! Once, they ran alone, surviving in solitude until fate brought them together. I watched their journey from their trainee days—at first, they fought to survive, then they learned to share both hardships and joy. Over time, they sacrificed for one another, bound by a love stronger than fear. And in the end, they stood side by side, unshaken, defying the cruelty of the world with unwavering loyalty and an unbreakable bond of friendship.",3,2025-03-24T14:49:26Z,0

On the surface, maybe rebels, misfits, werewolves, vampires, and more but look deeper and there seems to be a hidden message about the struggles of the KPOP industry, the struggles to lead and be free but being chained down by industry expectations. You find a brotherhood and you&#39;re determined not to let the essence of who you are be taken away from you so you try by any means to be happy and escape. The level of trust to be that raw....MAGICAL. Thank you for creating this artistic vision with such powerful messages. STRAY KIDS = VISIONARIES.",0,2025-03-24T14:44:32Z,0

@vivitarazgale2781,you might think that they are ex-lovers who used to be bad and did bad things but bang chan realized that he doesn&#39;t want that in his life and wanted hyunjin to become good with him but hyunjin refuses and then after 5 years bang chan is in a unit that catches criminals and finds out that they are looking for hyunjin and he applies for this job but actually wants to warn him and then he looks for him and they meet and enjoy their time again. They spend a lot of time together andbang chan had missed how good it felt to not be godd and do whatever he wants. when bang chan&#39;s teammates come to help they have already gotten too close and try to escape but hyunjin tries to defend himself while bang chan runs away and hyunjin is caught and imprisoned then hyunjin gets free and they run towards each other and meet in a tight hug and then those teammates come again but the power of love wins they join hands and attack back,0,2025-03-24T14:43:57Z,0

@shae-nr1ym,Omg wait so hyunjin is chained in the warehouse type of building Bangchan is free first it’s a full moon right?… Bangchan goes to hyunjin who looks to be chained when he says come with me let’s escape now hyunjins head angle looks very wolf like they then look to have a fight of sorts is Bangchan asserting dominance kind of style as he’s the leader? They then escape together right and at the end they run to each other after brief separation hug and then take on whatever it is that’s been holding them together? I know there’s some gaps that I’m missing but that’s just what has popped in my head so far I lowered the playback speed so I could take in the faster frames a bit easier and this is what I’ve interpreted 😮😅,0,2025-03-24T14:39:45Z,0
